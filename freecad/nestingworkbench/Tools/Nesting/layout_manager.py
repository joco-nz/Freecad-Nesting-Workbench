LayoutManager - Handles creation, cloning, and management of Layout objects.

This class is responsible for:
- Creating new layouts with master shapes and part instances
- Cloning layouts for GA population members
- Deleting layouts and all their child objects
- Calculating layout efficiency

Separates layout management from the nesting algorithm for cleaner architecture.
